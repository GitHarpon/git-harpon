#[Monaco Editor](https://github.com/Microsoft/monaco-editor)

# Introduction

This is an integration example to use Monaco editor in Electron app that uses Angular framework.

The following projects have been used:

 *  Maxime GRIS's ultralight Angular + Electron boilerplate: https://github.com/maximegris/angular-electron
 *  Teradata's fantastic Angular wrapper around Monaco editor: https://github.com/Teradata/covalent-code-editor
 *  And of course Monaco editor: https://microsoft.github.io/monaco-editor/

# Details

I made the following modification on orignal code:
 *  Teradata's original wrapper are able to used in non-electron environment. This code is removed, because I focused to Electron
 *  Because this boilerplate uses Angular CLI, I had to make some modification in ```MonacoEditorWrapperComponent``` constructor, to determine the proper application path
 *  The wrapper uses the Monaco editor that is in the node_modules, musn't copy the assets directory

# Main parts

 *  ```/src/electron-load.js```
 *  this script is loaded by angular.json
 *  ```/src/component/monaco-wrapper```


# Run, Build, etc
